// brew install llvm@18
// optionally
// brew install qt


// note:
// It is recommended to add your terminal application (i.e. Terminal.app or iTerm.app) to the system list of developer tools. Doing so will reduce slow startup time of freshly compiled binaries, due to macOS validating the binary on its first run. This can be done in the "Developer Tools" section of the "Privacy & Security" system settings.
